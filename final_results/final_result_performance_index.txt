 The performance index reported are defined as follow:

- Best IoU: it describe the best intersection of union between the ground truth rectangles and the filtered prediction did by the cascade of classifier algorithm
- average IoU: average of intersection of union between all the filtered prediction and all ground truth rectangles. In this case the false positive are not considered in the average operation.
- nÂ° false positive: filtered prediction given by cascade of classifier that deal with wrong detection
